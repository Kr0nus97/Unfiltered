- Dynamic Pseudonym Generation: Users are assigned a unique, randomly generated "Adjective_Object" pseudonym (e.g., "Brave_Carrot," "Silly_Table") for each post to ensure anonymity.
- Anonymous Posting: Enable users to post text, images, and links anonymously within relevant groups. Support Markdown formatting for text posts.
- Feedback Mechanism: Users can 'like' or 'dislike' posts to express sentiment.
- AI-Powered Moderation: Implement an AI tool to detect and flag hate speech, spam, and off-topic content. Human moderators will review flagged content for accuracy.
- Group Organization and Discovery: Organize discussions into interest-based groups that users can join. Include a search function for discovering new groups.
